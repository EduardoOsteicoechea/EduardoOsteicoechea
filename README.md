I'm Eduardo Osteicoechea, a licensed architect and Computer Science student at "Universidad Nacional Abierta" of Venezuela. I'm interested in multiplatform Agentic IoT integrations for the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) sector.

I love developing tailored and creative full-stack solutions with a wide range of technologies including C#, Rust, PHP, Python, SQL, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, CSS, and HTML, along with their related frameworks. I'm experienced in .NET, C#, WPF, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, HTML, and CSS.

I enjoy deploying low-cost monoliths on AWS EC2 instances using GitHub CI/CD workflows (check out my work at eduardoos.com) and have become enthusiastic about Linux and servers.

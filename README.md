I'm Eduardo Osteicoechea, a licensed architect from the Universidad de Los Andes in Venezuela, and a Computer Science student at the Universidad Nacional Abierta of Venezuela. I'm particularly interested in multiplatform Agentic IoT integrations for the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) sector.

I enjoy developing tailored and creative full-stack solutions using a wide range of technologies, including C#, Rust, PHP, Python, SQL, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, CSS, and HTML, along with their related frameworks. I'm experienced in .NET, C#, WPF, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, HTML, and CSS.

I also enjoy deploying low-cost monoliths on AWS EC2 instances using GitHub CI/CD workflows (you can see my work at eduardoos.com). Through this, I've become enthusiastic about Linux and servers.
